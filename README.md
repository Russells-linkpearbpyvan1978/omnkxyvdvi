Okay, so I just got out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Ad Vitam, and my brain is in a blender. Seriously, I don't even know where to start. There's something about  s that make you question everything—like, What if nobody ever dies?—and to be honest, it messes with my head. I went in expecting light sci-fi on a Saturday afternoon, and walked out thinking, Gee, life's pretty pointless if we live forever, isn't it?

Holy plot twist, Batman! Not to spoil stuff for you guys, but the characters were more complicated than a Rubik's Cube in Einstein's hands. I mean, the key character? Absolutely made me question my own motives as a human. Like, do I actually want immortality? Phew! Somebody should put a warning on these 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴: “Caution, viewer might become an existential philosopher!”

A bit annoying though, they didn't even wrap things up neatly. Damn it, I was craving resolution, but all I got is a heap of tangled questions. Like getting socks for Christmas when you wanted a PS5. I guess that’s the point? Still, I can’t tell if I should be mad, impressed, or just plain confused. 

> While walking back to my car, all I could think about was how weird it would be to play Monopoly with immortal people. How does that even work? Jail is actually not just a time-out anymore, it’s a painful reminder of eternity with no end in sight.

There's a teenage rebel in the   who reminds me of my 17-year-old self. Reckless and stubborn, fighting the system and all. And here I am, buying popcorn, refusing to pirate  s like a goody-two-shoes. Except I wasn’t a rebel, just really lazy, so 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   never seemed worth the hassle. My rebellious phase was not returning 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘺 books on time.

Oh! And the washed-out grey tones—like a rain cloud got drunk and puked all over the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. Effective? Sure, but someone please pass them a color wheel next time!

function keepLiving(immortality) { return immortality ? 'Oh look, more problems' : 'Phew, normal-length problems'; }

Wrapping it up, I don't know if I loved or hated Ad Vitam. Depends on when you ask me. I walked in exhausted, kinda annoyed from a long day, and now here I am, scribbling these wild thoughts like a caffeinated squirrel. If you're up for a ride that feels more like philosophical hot yoga than standard cinema, then go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . If not, maybe leave immortality questioning to the philosophers, and save your energy for something else. Or just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it anyway and join me in the existential dread club!
